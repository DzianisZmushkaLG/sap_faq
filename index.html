											<td>Do we need separate transports for country-specific customizing?</td>
											<td>For SAP Central Business Configuration, there is one transport request per milestone as shown in the demo. For configurations via self-service configuration user interfaces (SSCUIs), you are free to create separate transports. However, if there are multiple transports, you have to be aware of the dependencies. There will be a minimum of 2 transports – one with SAP Central Business Configuration and one with SSCUI.<br>
												SAP recommends that you start with one “default customizing” request and there can be only one “default customizing” request. For urgent changes, you can use additional transport requests. And in principle, you can also create a transport per country, LoB, etc. But we recommend separate transports only if you are sure that the configuration is independent from each other.</td>
